# GoalPop


Babes Having Fun Coding

## Overview
This app is all about completing your goals. Our vision was to create an app that allows users to track their goals and manage them in a fun and fresh way!

## How to Run the App

## GoalPop Structure:

## Future Work:
We had many ideas for GoalPop, however with the compressed time period we unfortunately could not get to everything. Future work on GoalPop could include:
* Adding sub-sections to goals
    * This would allow users to break their goals down into smaller steps and visually and conceptually.
    The bubbles would then appear in either a pie chart format or a bullseye format. When completing a sub-goal,
    the bubble will then adapt and remove the completed sub-goal.
* Improved List Tab
    * Users could edit and delete goals in the List Tab.
* Adding a calendar-backing
    * There are many ways GoalPop could evolve with a calendar backing. Users could set deadlines for their goals for example, with this the bubbles
     could increasingly change size as the deadline approaches or the user could receive reminders.
     * GoalPop could also give users an option to create daily goals that re-appear every morning for users to complete.
* Animations / Noises
    * To make popping the bubbles more satisfying for the user, we could implement a popping noise or an animation more similar to a popping bubble.
* Personalization
    * Users could pick their color swatch for the bubbles for increased personalization.
    * Users could move the bubbles around the screen to help them visualize their goals more efficiently.
* Refactoring
   * With more time, we would refactor the Main Activity--creating an animation class and bubble manager class.
