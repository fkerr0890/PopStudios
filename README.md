##Future Work:
We had many ideas for GoalPop, however with the compressed time period we unfortunately could not get to everything. Future work on GoalPop could include:
*Adding sub-sections to goals
    *This would allow users to break their goals down into smaller steps and visually and conceptually.
    The bubbles would then appear in either a pie chart format or a bullseye format. When completing a sub-goal,
    the bubble will then adapt and remove the completed sub-goal.
*Improved List Tab
    *Users could edit and delete goals in the List Tab.
*Adding a calendar-backing
    *There are many ways GoalPop could evolve with a calendar backing. Users could set deadlines for their goals for example, with this the bubbles
     could increasingly change size as the deadline approaches or the user could receive reminders.
     *GoalPop could also give users an option to create daily goals that re-appear every morning for users to complete.
*Animations / Noises
    *To make popping the bubbles more satisfying for the user, we could implement a popping noise or an animation more similar to a popping bubble.
*Personalization
    *Users could pick their color swatch for the bubbles for increased personalization.
    *Users could move the bubbles around the screen to help them visualize their goals more efficiently.
