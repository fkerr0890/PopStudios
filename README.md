# GoalPop


Babes Having Fun Coding

## Overview
This app is all about completing your goals. Our vision was to create an app that allows users to track their goals and manage them in a fun and fresh way! In our app users can define their own goals, rank their importance and difficulty, and keep them all in one place, as bubbles on a screen. When a user completes a goal, it will "pop" and our app updates it in the list view to show it's completed. This will hopefully provide an extra sense of motivation to the user as they can see what they've accomplished using our app.

We built this app for COMP 225 Software Design and Development. Through this project we learned about the layered process of building an app, responsibility in a group project, and collaboration through remote learning. We honed our coding skills in Java/XML and our ability to build something from scratch. Our app is free and can be used on Android phones (or run through an emulator).

## How to Run the App

## GoalPop Structure:
See GoalPop Class Structure.png

## Possible Bugs:
There have been issues with the list view not matching the bubble view but these usually resolve themselves upon restarting the app.

## Future Work:
We had many ideas for GoalPop, however with the compressed time period we unfortunately could not get to everything. Future work on GoalPop could include:
* Adding sub-sections to goals
    * This would allow users to break their goals down into smaller steps and visually and conceptually.
    The bubbles would then appear in either a pie chart format or a bullseye format. When completing a sub-goal,
    the bubble will then adapt and remove the completed sub-goal.
* Improved List Tab
    * Users could edit and delete goals in the List Tab.
* Adding a calendar-backing
    * There are many ways GoalPop could evolve with a calendar backing. Users could set deadlines for their goals for example, with this the bubbles
     could increasingly change size as the deadline approaches or the user could receive reminders.
     * GoalPop could also give users an option to create daily goals that re-appear every morning for users to complete.
* Animations / Noises
    * To make popping the bubbles more satisfying for the user, we could implement a popping noise or an animation more similar to a popping bubble.
* Personalization
    * Users could pick their color swatch for the bubbles for increased personalization.
    * Users could move the bubbles around the screen to help them visualize their goals more efficiently.
* Refactoring
   * With more time, we would refactor the Main Activity--creating an animation class and bubble manager class.
